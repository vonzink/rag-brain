/**
 * Heuristic routing intent for an EDUCATIONAL question, computed AFTER the
 * compliance {@link QuestionCategory} gate and BEFORE retrieval. This is a
 * separate concept from {@link QuestionCategory}: the category enum is the
 * compliance guardrail (it decides whether we answer at all); Intent is a
 * downstream hint about HOW to retrieve/answer, consumed by later phases.
 *
 * <p>Phase 5 only computes and logs the intent — nothing reads it yet, so the
 * pipeline behaves identically to today. {@code GUIDELINE_QUESTION} is the
 * neutral default returned for ordinary guideline questions and for any
 * null/blank input, preserving the classifier's proceed-by-default anchor.
 *
 * <p><b>Spec §7.3 reconciliation:</b> the spec lists five intent names:
 * {@code question_answering}, {@code page_guidance}, {@code external_reference},
 * {@code calculator}, and {@code handoff}. The Java enum uses deliberate
 * renames: {@code GUIDELINE_QUESTION} (was {@code question_answering}) and
 * {@code CALCULATION} (was {@code calculator}) are idiomatic UPPER_SNAKE Java
 * names. {@code handoff} is intentionally deferred — there is no consumer for
 * it until a later phase — so no {@code HANDOFF} constant is added here.
